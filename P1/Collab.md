**Meetings and Agile Methodology:**

After our previous meetings (which took place during scheduled lecture, lab and tutorial times) and given our previous experience with other project courses we’ve decided on the following logistics for our meeting.
 
- _Location_ : Bahen & Online via Messenger
- _When_ : Monday’s during scheduled tutorial time with additional meetings online or during Friday’s scheduled tutorial time if needed. 
- _Attendance_ : We will meet at least once a week primarily on Mondays during lecture time. Group members are expected to attend all meetings unless circumstances permit absence. 
- _What_ : Our meetings will serve as a weekly ‘stand-up’ meeting in which we discuss the work we’ve done for the previous week, what work we plan to complete for the current week and any difficulties we encountered. 
- _Agile Methodology_ : SCRUM

**Shared Documents** 

We will be sharing documents via our GitHub repository and Google Docs with links distributed within our Messenger server.

**Work Division**

We will be splitting the implementation of our project between two main groups, the front end sub team and the backend subteam. Each subteam will be responsible for how their team specific work is split among them. We will also have a floater who will help with both teams in order to help us adapt when one team’s workload is higher than the other.

- Backend: Kory Mclean, Christopher Chiu
- Frontend: Jayde Yue, Ellen (Yufei) Chen
- Floater: Reece Martin
