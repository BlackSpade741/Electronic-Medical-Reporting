# Electronic-Medical-Reporting:
This project comes from a University Class at the University of Toronto (CSC302: Engineering Large Software Systems). The team consisted of Christopher Chiu, Kory McLean, Ellen Chen, Reece Martin and Jayde Yue. 

## What it does:
This project is developed to help doctors keep patient medical records using a standardized forms in XML file format defined by a third party. Our application ingests this XML, parses it, stores it, dynamically renders it, and allows for form filling the the associated actions with saved responses.

## How it was built:
The application was built as a Web-App with a Frontend composed of ReactJS with UI Components from Material UI and Routing with React Router. The Backend was created with Django and stores files in an SQLite Database.

## My Contribution:
My contributions to the project were primarily in the Frontend where I helped create the login page, and form upload functionality. I also played a significant role in the dynamic rendering or the forms.

## Notable Elements: 

### Dependent Questions

### Recursive Rendering of Components

### Displaying the Correct Form Filling Control based on Context
